# Hi there, I'm RockeyWereWolf 👋 

## I'm Software Developer who really likes to try himself in new and undiscovered fields

- My most used stack at the moment include, but not exclude:
  <br>
  [![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=py,pytorch,cpp,c,cs,dotnet,linux,arch,bash,docker,githubactions)](https://skillicons.dev)
  <br>
  Python for my ML/modern AI techniques, C/C++ mostly for side projects, C# for Web Backend(but i lost interest in it)

- I am constantly sys admining my home pc, since I am using an Arch Linux, and tend to design my own user experience as much as possible. DWM taught me to get used to "patching" software that doesnt solve my personal needs, and then I even started to develop my own mini-apps to enhance system's overall feel. That really changes your mind from just a expert sys admin to entry-level system architect

- I often use my OCI free tier to host applications, websites and game servers for myself or friends, and also was developing CI/CD pipelines, mostly in GitHub Actions, for my student projects back then. To just commit my repo from any computer, and almost instantly see the change in application hosted in cloud.

## Repos

Unfortunately, most of my repost there are PRIVATE, and even so, most of my projects are local. I tend to consider them solving my own needs and preferences and therefore tend to not publish them somewhere. I will systematize them in this section, in future.
For now, just see repositories tab of profile itself.

### The current systematic list of my public repos:

1. **[ProjectBeta](https://github.com/RockeyWereWolf/ProjectBeta)** 
   ![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%2B%2B-00599C?style=flat-square&logo=c%2B%2B&logoColor=white) ![Vulkan](https://img.shields.io/badge/Vulkan-AC171F?style=flat-square&logo=vulkan&logoColor=white)
   C++ Vulkan API based(not from scratch, Dilligent Engine for some abstractions), Minecraft Beta 1.7.3 port/rewrite project. Just for fun.

2. **[bspwm-nounmap](https://github.com/RockeyWereWolf/bspwm-nounmap)** 
   ![C](https://img.shields.io/badge/C-A8B9CC?style=flat-square&logo=c&logoColor=black) ![Shell](https://img.shields.io/badge/Shell_Script-121011?style=flat-square&logo=gnu-bash&logoColor=white)
   Published state of my patched bspwm, there are some other forks that do the same. There are some bugs with apps, use with caution. I will appreciate help of anyone, who will report or find any issue. But, I plan to move from bspw/x to Niri/Wayland, since it does literally the same thing this "no unmap patch", but on fundemantal concept way, not as hacky patch.

3. **[FriendsMCLauncher](https://github.com/RockeyWereWolf/FriendsMCLauncher)** 
   ![C#](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%23-239120?style=flat-square&logo=c-sharp&logoColor=white)
   Yeah... Idk why I made it public, repo description is pretty explanatory.

4. **[dedeqorqudpostgresearch](https://github.com/RockeyWereWolf/dedeqorqudpostgresearch)** 
   ![Go](https://img.shields.io/badge/Go-00ADD8?style=flat-square&logo=go&logoColor=white) ![Postgres](https://img.shields.io/badge/PostgreSQL-4169E1?style=flat-square&logo=postgresql&logoColor=white) ![Docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/Docker-2496ED?style=flat-square&logo=docker&logoColor=white)
   My first and last PUBLIC Go, PostgreSQL, Docker and github actions CI/CD project. [This one](https://github.com/RockeyWereWolf/docker-compose-gitops-action) was forked from github actions marketplace(?) and patched by me to solve one ssh issue I had to just smoothly build and deploy project to my OCI computer instance. 

5. And others will be added later....

## My OS journey:

- 🗓️ **2009 - 2024**: `Windows XP` ➔ `7` ➔ `10`
- 🚀 **Since 2024 - Now**: ![Arch Linux](https://img.shields.io/badge/Arch%20Linux-1793D1?style=flat-square&logo=arch-linux&logoColor=white) **Bare bone Arch Linux**, just for fun.
